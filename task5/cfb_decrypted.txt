the oscars turn  on sunday which seems about right after this long strange
awards trIp the bagg¥Ók—¡ì¿‰uÍÆªÏ®nonagenarian too

the awards race was bookended by the demise of harvey weinstein at its outset
and the apparent implosion of his film company at the end and it was shaped by
the emergence of metoo times up blackgown politics armcandy activism and
a national conversation as brief and mad as a fever dream about whether there
ought to be a president winfrey the season didnt just seem extra long it was
extra long because the oscars were moved to the first weekend in march to
avoid conflicting with the closing ceremony of the winter olympics thanks
pyeongchang

one big question surrounding this years academy awards is how or if the
ceremony will address metoo especially after the golden globes which became
a jubilant comingout party for times up the movement spearheaded by 
powerful hollywood women who helped raise millions of dollars to fight sexual
harassment around the country

signaling their support golden globes attendees swathed themselves in black
sported lapel pins and sounded off about sexist power imbalances from the red
carpet and the stage on the air e was called out about pay inequity after
its former anchor catt sadler quit once she learned that she was making far
less than a male cohost and during the ceremony natalie portman took a blunt
and satisfying dig at the allmale roster of nominated directors how could
that be topped
